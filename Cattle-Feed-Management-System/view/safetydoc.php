<h2>Why is Cattle Feed Safety Important?</h2>
<p id="demo">Animal feed plays a leading role in the global food industry and it is the largest and most 
important component to ensure the sustainable production of safe and affordable animal proteins. 
Rapidly growing populations, along with increased urbanization and income, is expected to rise 
the consumption of animal products by 70% in 2050. The increase in animal production will 
require an additional amount of feed to be produced. The challenge is not only to meet the 
growing demand for feed, but to ensure its safety. Feed safety is a prerequisite for food safety 
and human health</p>
